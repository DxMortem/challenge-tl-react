# Challenge-TL-React

Welcome to my TL Challenge!

My name is Diego Borrero and I'll guide you by this store
First of all and as you maybe already know by the project name, you should know that this store is powered by react and Vite

## Tech Stack

For this project I decided to use the next stack:

- React
- Vite + SWC (For Fast Refresh + Hot Module Replacement)
- React-Router-DOM
- Tailwind.css
- Some components of Flowbite
- icons from React-Icons
- Jest
- [jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) + [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) (To do unit test over renders and verify things into the page)
- Others
